# Battle Engine

Basic idea: accept input, run through stages.  each creature runs
through same stages depending on who goes first. core stages like
start turn, end turn

## stages

Start turn -> decided ordering

committer attack phase
receiver damage phase
effect application phase
committer end phase

repeat for second actor

end turn state
