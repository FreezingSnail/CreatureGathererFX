# CreatureGathererFX-xrm.1

- Defined stable Make API: `setup`, `doctor`, `gen`, `test`, `testvm`, `build`, `check`, `fxtest`; `make help` documents prerequisites, outputs, optional Ardens behavior, and supported overrides.
- Replaced path-fragile host includes and sprite inputs with repository-relative paths. `FQBN`, `ARDUINO_CLI`, `BUILD_DIR`, `DIST_DIR`, `FXDATA_BIN`, and test-output variables support local/CI overrides.
- Moved host-test executables under ignored `build/`; packaged FX output uses ignored `dist/`. `check` now includes VM tests.
- Added `tools/tests/make-contract-test.sh`: validates help surface and FQBN/output directory overrides without Arduino hardware.

# CreatureGathererFX-xrm.2

Added deterministic `schema_version: 1` FX provenance manifests. Each manifest records `cgfx-tools` name/version, target, SHA-256 checksums for discovered generation inputs, every packaged FX payload, generated FX artifact, and generated device fixture.

`tools/assert-fxdata-manifest.sh` strictly validates schema and rejects malformed, missing, changed, and unrecorded files with path, hash state, and `make gen` remediation. Use `make verify-generated` for non-mutating verification; `make test-manifest` runs permanent fixture-backed shell coverage.

FX packing is native `cgfx-tools`; `fxlayout.toml` uses raw, image, C-array, builder, and typed-symbol sources without the Python bridge.

# CreatureGathererFX-b2a.1

Implementation: native `Arduboy2Base` renderer; interim plane-1 `FRAME(x)` mapping; 52 FPS loop; removed obsolete `FRAMESHIFT` after grep. Only permitted files changed: `CreatureGathererFX.ino`, `src/common.hpp`.

Size delta: flash `18314 -> 17960 B` (`-354 B`); globals `2018 -> 2019 B` (`+1 B`), `541 B` free; limit `2026 B`, headroom `7 B`.

Wall time (worker): approximately 1m15s (2026-10-01 18:13:10 EDT through 18:14:25 EDT).

Deviation: skipped `make run` because it opens interactive GUI, per worker instruction. Ardens visual check remains pending orchestrator; owner hardware check on new FX unit pending.

Automated gates: PASS. No commits, pushes, or `bd dolt push` performed.

Orchestrator (b2a.1): added the interim `FRAME` comment required by the design. Re-ran `make build` (flash 17960, globals 2019), `make test`, `make testvm`, full `make fxtest-headless` (9/9 PASS). Wall time: worker 95 s (gpt-5.6-luna). Ardens visual check and owner hardware check pending.

# CreatureGathererFX-jp8.5.10

Implementation: added the header-only lure/item id contract in `src/item/ItemIds.hpp`, host coverage in `tst/item_test.hpp`, and registered `ItemSuite` in `tst/main.cpp`. The header includes only `<stdint.h>`, keeps `ItemKind` based on `uint8_t`, and contains the required arithmetic-shape comment and compile-time assertions.

# CreatureGathererFX-jp8.5.11

Implementation: added the 32-byte indexed inventory module with saturating add, all-or-nothing take, key/out-of-range rejection, and the frozen lure-then-consumable nonzero walk. Extended the existing item suite with inventory coverage and added `Inventory.cpp` to host test sources.

```

Size delta: static globals `2019 -> 2019 B` (`0 B`); flash `17960 B` after the module. The inventory has no global instance.

Wall time (worker): approximately 45 seconds for implementation and requested acceptance commands (excluding earlier bead inspection).

Deviation: none. No commit or push performed.

Size: `make build` reports 2019 B globals and 541 B free. This matches the existing `output.md` baseline after b2a.1 (2019 B globals); the initial fresh baseline attempt was blocked by the Arduino cache permission error above. This change adds no static storage: the constants and functions are compile-time/header-only, and the new tests run on the host.

Wall time (worker): approximately 6 minutes including the approved `make build` and full `make check`; final gate (make check): approximately 25 seconds.

Deviation: the first sandbox attempts for `make build` and `make check` were blocked by Arduino cache read/cleanup permissions. Both required gates completed successfully after approval to run outside the sandbox. No commits or pushes performed.

# CreatureGathererFX-jp8.5.12

Implementation: added `item::KeyItems`, a one-byte unlocked-bit store in the independent key-item ID namespace, with clear, query, unlock, and out-of-range guards. Extended `ItemSuite` to verify per-ID bits, idempotence, invalid IDs, and isolation from `FLAG_BIT_ARRAY`; registered `KeyItems.cpp` in host sources.

```

Size delta: static globals `2019 -> 2019 B` (`0 B`); flash remains `17960 B`. This module has no global instance, and the size matches the jp8.5.11 baseline.

Wall time: acceptance commands approximately 51 seconds (`make test` 2 s, `make build` 5 s, `make check` 44 s); total worker elapsed time approximately 1m41s, 2026-10-01 20:16:25–20:18:06 EDT.

Deviation: none. No commits or pushes performed.

# CreatureGathererFX-jp8.5.15

Implementation: appended 3 lure tier, 8 lure type, and 8 consumable name strings and order entries; added `item::ItemName`/`itemNameAddr` with tier-then-type lure resolution and guarded IDs; extended `ItemSuite` for index arithmetic and FX read counts. The existing declaration and order counts were **104**, not the bead's stale 106; both now have **123** entries with the first 104 preserved and no duplicate declaration names. `make gen-sprites` and `make gen` published the three new index tables in `src/fxdata.h`.

Kept the historical 304-entry pack-layout migration proof by excluding only the 19 new sprites and 3 new index tables from its two expanded fixtures. Both the positive equivalence and intentionally perturbed negative diagnostic pass. Refreshed the packed-image SHA-256 baseline to `42873ff66900cdd6b135de95c3be0088dddf0a487b05f29d69b67c068cf1b57c`; updated the independently pinned `MenuStrings` table address in the first-unqualified-alias check to `0x04F8C3`.

git diff --check                 PASS
```

Size delta: flash and global SRAM match the prior item-bead baseline (17,960 B and 2,019 B). `itemNameAddr` is not linked into the shipping sketch yet; it has no current device-size effect.

Wall time: approximately 9 minutes including fixture investigation and gate runs; full final gate 48.67 seconds. Deviations: initial `make test-generated-libs` found the old pinned table address, and the first `make test-pack-parity` observed the expected old SHA mismatch; both were corrected and rerun. First sandbox `make build` attempt could not clean the Arduino cache; the approved escalated rerun passed. No commit or push performed.

# CreatureGathererFX-qu9.2 — pre-fix stack baseline

Implementation: scaffolded the permanent device suite with `make new-fxtest NAME=stack`. It paints `[&__bss_end, SP - 64)` through a volatile pointer, runs the VM, battle turn, menu render, and save compaction, then reports base/top/low-water/headroom and checks collision plus the pinned 128 B minimum. The large `SaveFile` snapshot lives in a noinline save helper so the initial paint runs from a shallow frame. The test sketch supplies the production `ScriptVm` global omitted by the shared FX test harness.

Commands and results:

```

Baseline: the low-water mark clobbered BSS at `0x8B2` (0 B headroom) while the pinned minimum is 128 B. The suite completes the save chain and emits the exact `F` marker. This is the required pre-qu9.1/qu9.3 baseline; rerun after those fixes and require `P` before closing qu9.2. The full device gate is intentionally deferred to the orchestrator's integrated stack wave.

Wall time: approximately 5 minutes for the worker, including diagnosis and targeted reruns; final targeted device run 1.6 seconds. Deviation: initial sandbox cache access needed the already approved elevated rerun. No commit, push, or bd closure performed.
